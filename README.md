# restaurant-page

[Restaurant Page project!](https://homeworkmon.github.io/restaurant-page/)

JS organization inspired by [micalosman](https://github.com/michalosman/restaurant-page) (ty!)

#### Despite the very simple design and unoriginal code I learned some important config stuff this time including: 

1. how to organize Javascript into modules and bundle code with Webpack!
2. dynamically rendering DOM elements with Javascript
3. Better file structuring - using dist + src folders for webpage resources
4. How to use npm on the command line and package.json dependencies!
5. First time setting up a .gitignore for a project :)
